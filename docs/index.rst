OpenClimate PyClient Documentation
===================================

**OpenClimate** aggregates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from states and non-state actors
as well as emission pledges into single a platform. The OpenClimate PyClient is wrapper around the
`OpenClimate API <https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/OpenClimate/blob/develop/api/API.md>`_
to make the data more accessible to the Python community.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
